# 🍽️ Diet Recommendation Project

This **Diet Recommendation Project** is a Python-based application that helps users receive personalized diet suggestions and meal plans based on their nutritional needs, preferences, and daily goals.

The application consists of multiple modules that handle login, user information, nutritional analysis, progress tracking, and weekly diet planning.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a **user-centric diet recommendation system** that can:

- Collect user details (e.g., age, weight, goals)
- Provide tailored nutritional information
- Generate weekly diet plans
- Track user diet progress

This project demonstrates practical Python programming and modular code design.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **User Login**  
   Users start with a login screen to enter their credentials and access the app.

2. **Input Personal Details**  
   After login, users input their personal and health details like age, height, weight, and dietary goals.

3. **Nutrition Calculation**  
   The system analyzes the user’s nutritional needs and creates recommendations accordingly.

4. **Weekly Diet Plan**  
   A weekly meal plan is generated based on the nutritional recommendation logic.

5. **Progress Tracking**  
   Users can view and track their diet progress over time.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python  
- Standard libraries (Tkinter or another GUI library, depending on implementation)  
- Custom modules to separate logic  
- Simple file-based or in-memory user data handling

🧪 Features
✔ User Login and Access Control
✔ Personalized Diet Recommendation
✔ Nutritional Information Display
✔ Weekly Meal Plan Generation
✔ Progress Tracking

📌 Notes
This project uses modular Python files for each feature.

It can be enhanced using a GUI framework like Tkinter or Streamlit to improve usability.

Future improvements can include database integration and more advanced recommendation logic.
